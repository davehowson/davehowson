### Hello there 👋

I am a fullstack web application developer from Sri Lanka 🌊 and I absolutely love to code 💻 <br/>
I am currently working as a Software Engineer at [Multiplier](https://www.usemultiplier.com/), which is APAC's first and fastest growing PEO platform 🌏 <br/>
I'm constantly working on improving my coding skills, learning new technologies and building hobby projects 👾  <br/>
If you're interested in working with me, I'd be glad to hear from you 📞

My primary web development stack is 
* React.js
* Vue.js
* Node.js

But I also love working with Laravel and Django. <br/>
I write articles whenever I can find some free time. You can find them on [dev.to](https://dev.to/davehowson) </br>
